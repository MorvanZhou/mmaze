    The Algorithm

    1. Choose an arbitrary cell from the grid, and add it to some
        (initially empty) set visited nodes (V).
    2. Randomly select a wall from the grid that connects a cell in
        V with another cell not in V.
    3. Add that wall to the Minimal Spanning Tree (MST), and the edge's other cell to V.
    4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until V includes every cell in G.
